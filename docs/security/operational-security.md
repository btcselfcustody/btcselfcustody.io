# Operational Security for Bitcoiners

Your behavior matters as much as your technical setup.

:::info What is OpSec?
**Operational Security (OpSec)** is about protecting sensitive information through careful behavior. The best hardware wallet in the world won't help if you tell everyone about your Bitcoin or fall for a phishing attack.
:::

## The Human Element

Most Bitcoin losses aren't from sophisticated hacks—they're from human error:

- Clicking phishing links
- Sharing too much information
- Trusting the wrong people
- Not verifying before acting
- Social engineering attacks

**Your security is only as strong as your weakest moment.**


## Core OpSec Principles

### 1. Don't Talk About Your Holdings

:::danger The #1 Rule
The single most important OpSec rule: **don't tell people you own Bitcoin**.

Every person who knows is a potential:
- Social engineering vector
- Physical threat source
- Gossip chain starting point
:::

**What to avoid:**
- Posting about Bitcoin on social media with your real identity
- Telling coworkers, acquaintances, or extended family
- Wearing Bitcoin merchandise
- Having Bitcoin stickers on your laptop/car
- Discussing specific amounts with anyone

**What's acceptable:**
- Discussing Bitcoin conceptually without revealing ownership
- Talking with close, trusted family who need to know (inheritance)
- Anonymous participation in Bitcoin communities

### 2. Verify Everything

**Trust no one. Verify everything.**

| Scenario | What to Verify |
|----------|----------------|
| Receiving address | Confirm on hardware wallet screen |
| Software download | Check official website, verify signatures |
| Firmware update | Verify on manufacturer's website first |
| "Support" contact | Companies never DM you first |
| Investment opportunity | If it sounds too good, it's a scam |

**Common verification failures:**
- Trusting addresses shown only on computer screen
- Downloading wallet software from Google ads
- Responding to "support" messages on social media
- Clicking links in emails claiming to be from exchanges

### 3. Assume Compromise

Operate as if every device could be compromised:

- **Your computer** — Could have malware showing fake addresses
- **Your phone** — Could be SIM-swapped or have spyware
- **Your email** — Could be accessed by attackers
- **Public WiFi** — Could be monitored
- **Cloud storage** — Could be breached

**Mitigations:**
- Verify addresses on hardware wallet, not computer
- Use hardware security keys for important accounts
- Don't store seeds digitally anywhere
- Use a VPN on public networks
- Enable 2FA everywhere (preferably hardware-based)

### 4. Compartmentalize

Don't put all your eggs in one basket:

- **Multiple wallets** for different purposes
- **Separate email** for Bitcoin-related accounts
- **Different identities** for Bitcoin vs. personal life
- **Geographic distribution** of backups
- **Multiple devices** — dedicated Bitcoin computer if possible

### 5. Minimize Your Attack Surface

Every connection is a potential vulnerability:

- Fewer accounts = fewer breach points
- Fewer people who know = fewer social engineering vectors
- Fewer devices = fewer compromise points
- Less public presence = less targeting


## Practical OpSec Checklist

### Daily Habits

- [ ] Never discuss specific holdings
- [ ] Verify addresses on hardware device before sending
- [ ] Don't click links in emails—navigate directly to sites
- [ ] Use unique passwords for every account
- [ ] Be suspicious of unsolicited contact

### Communication Security

- [ ] Use encrypted messaging (Signal) for sensitive discussions
- [ ] Don't discuss Bitcoin on SMS or regular email
- [ ] Be vague if asked about Bitcoin ownership
- [ ] Never share your seed phrase with anyone for any reason

### Device Security

- [ ] Keep operating systems updated
- [ ] Use reputable antivirus/anti-malware
- [ ] Don't install unnecessary software
- [ ] Consider a dedicated Bitcoin-only device
- [ ] Use hardware security keys where possible

### Account Security

- [ ] Enable 2FA on all accounts (hardware key > authenticator app > SMS)
- [ ] Use unique, strong passwords (password manager)
- [ ] Separate email for financial/Bitcoin accounts
- [ ] Monitor accounts for unauthorized access
- [ ] Use privacy-focused email provider


## Social Engineering Awareness

**Social engineering** is manipulating people into giving up information or access. It's the most common attack vector.

### Common Attacks

**Phishing**
- Fake emails/websites that look legitimate
- "Your account has been compromised, click here"
- Fake wallet software or browser extensions

**Impersonation**
- "Tech support" reaching out to help
- Someone claiming to be from your exchange
- "Moderators" in Telegram/Discord groups

**Romance/Trust Scams**
- Building relationship to eventually request funds
- "Investment opportunities" from new friends
- Fake job offers requiring Bitcoin transactions

**Urgency/Fear**
- "Act now or lose your funds"
- "Your account will be locked"
- Pressure to make quick decisions

### Defense

- **Slow down** — Urgency is a red flag
- **Verify independently** — Don't use links provided; navigate directly
- **Question everything** — Why would they contact you?
- **Never share seeds** — No legitimate entity ever needs this
- **Confirm through other channels** — Call the company directly


## OpSec for Different Threat Levels

### Casual Holder
- Don't discuss holdings publicly
- Use hardware wallet
- Strong passwords + 2FA
- Basic verification habits

### Serious Holder
- All of above, plus:
- Dedicated email for Bitcoin
- More careful about who knows
- Run your own node
- Consider VPN usage

### High-Value Holder
- All of above, plus:
- Dedicated Bitcoin device
- Strict compartmentalization
- Geographic distribution
- Consider legal structures
- Professional security review


## Red Flags Checklist

**Immediate danger signs:**

🚩 Anyone asking for your seed phrase
🚩 "Support" contacting you first
🚩 Urgency pressure ("act now!")
🚩 Requests for remote access
🚩 Investment opportunities that seem too good
🚩 Links in emails or DMs
🚩 Requests to "verify" your wallet
🚩 Anyone claiming they can "recover" lost Bitcoin


## Summary

Good OpSec is about:

1. **Silence** — Don't reveal you own Bitcoin
2. **Verification** — Confirm everything independently
3. **Assumption** — Treat all devices as potentially compromised
4. **Compartmentalization** — Separate concerns and identities
5. **Minimization** — Reduce your attack surface
6. **Skepticism** — Question unsolicited contact

The technical security of Bitcoin is excellent. The weak point is always human behavior.
