# Start Here: Your Bitcoin Self-Custody Journey

:::tip Welcome
You're about to learn how to truly own your Bitcoin. Not a balance on someone else's computer—actual, sovereign ownership that no one can take from you.

This is both powerful and serious. Take your time.
:::

## What is Self-Custody?

When you buy Bitcoin on an exchange, you don't actually *own* it yet. You own a promise—an IOU from a company that says they'll give you Bitcoin when you ask.

**Self-custody** means taking possession of your Bitcoin by controlling your own private keys. It's the difference between:

| Exchange Account | Self-Custody |
|------------------|--------------|
| Company holds your Bitcoin | You hold your Bitcoin |
| They can freeze your account | No one can freeze your funds |
| You need their permission to withdraw | You don't need anyone's permission |
| If they get hacked, you lose funds | Your security is in your hands |
| "Not your keys, not your coins" | Your keys, your coins |

Self-custody is how Bitcoin was designed to work. It's also a responsibility—there's no customer support, no password reset, and no reversing mistakes.

→ **Deep dive:** [What is Self-Custody?](/docs/learn/fundamentals/what-is-self-custody) explains this in full detail.


## Before You Continue: A Word of Caution

:::danger This is Serious
Self-custody means **you are responsible** for your Bitcoin. If you:

- Lose your seed phrase → Your Bitcoin is gone forever
- Show your seed phrase to someone → They can steal everything
- Make a backup mistake → You might not be able to recover

There is no "forgot password" button. No customer support. No second chances.

**This isn't meant to scare you away—it's meant to make you take this seriously.**
:::

The good news: millions of people successfully self-custody their Bitcoin. With the right knowledge and care, you can too.

| **Privacy-focused / high-risk** | Start with [Why Privacy Matters](/docs/learn/privacy/why-privacy-matters) |


## Assess Your Threat Model

Not everyone needs the same level of security. A good setup depends on:

1. **How much Bitcoin are you protecting?**
   - Small amounts → Software wallet may be fine
   - Meaningful savings → Hardware wallet recommended
   - Life-changing amounts → Consider multisig

2. **What are you protecting against?**
   - Casual hackers → Hardware wallet handles this
   - Targeted attackers → Air-gapped setups, multisig
   - State-level threats → Maximum operational security

3. **What's your technical comfort?**
   - Non-technical → Start simple, learn gradually
   - Technical → Can jump to advanced setups

## The Self-Custody Mindset

Before you dive into guides, internalize these principles:

### 1. Verify, Don't Trust

Don't take anyone's word for it—including this site. Verify addresses on your hardware wallet screen. Run your own node. Check multiple sources.

### 2. Move Slowly

There's no rush. A mistake with Bitcoin can be permanent. Read guides twice. Test with small amounts. Ask questions before acting.

### 3. Assume Compromise

Treat every device as potentially compromised. Air-gap when possible. Verify firmware. Don't trust, verify.

### 4. Separate Concerns

Don't keep all your eggs in one basket. Geographic distribution. Different wallet types for different purposes. Backup redundancy.

### 5. Practice Recovery

A backup you've never tested isn't a backup. Verify your seed restores correctly *before* depositing significant funds.
