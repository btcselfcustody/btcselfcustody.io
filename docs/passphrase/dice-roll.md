# Roll the Dice

Now it's time to generate your own passphrase using real dice. As we mentioned in the Seed Phrase Guide, using casino-grade dice ensures the highest level of randomness (entropy). However, if you want to save money, any standard six-sided dice will work just fine. Even if your dice have slight imperfections, rolling multiple dice at a time will still provide sufficient randomness for a secure passphrase.

For this method, five dice are enough to generate each word.

Before rolling the dice remember that:

- Each word is generated by rolling one die five times or five dice once, providing **12.9 bits of entropy** per word.
- A six-word passphrase gives **77 bits of entrop**y, which is strong security.
- For even stronger security, consider **seven or eight words** (90.3 or 103.2 bits of entropy, respectively).


### How to Generate Your Passphrase

- Roll five dice at once.
- Record the five-digit number they form (e.g., 52465).
- Look up the matching word in the EFF Long Word List (e.g., **52465 = running**).
- Repeat this process until you have **at least six words** for a secure passphrase.


Your final numbers might look like this:

```test
52465 16663 55321 66621 22166 23234
```

Which translates to your final passphrase:

```text
running cope snowfield yippee darling diaphragm
```

Your passphrase is now ready to use!
