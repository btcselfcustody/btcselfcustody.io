# Backup your Passphrase

Just like your Bitcoin seed phrase, your passphrase is a critical key to your funds. If you lose it or it gets compromised, your Bitcoin is gone forever. That’s why proper security is essential.

While paper and digital backups can degrade, get lost, or be destroyed, metal seed storage provides a durable, fireproof, and waterproof solution for long-term security.

:::danger
Never store your passphrase in the same place as your seed phrase.
If both are found together, a thief could access your Bitcoin instantly with no extra effort needed. Keep them separate to ensure maximum security.

### Memorize Your Passphrase

:::warning
This method is only recommended if you have multiple secure backups.
:::

You can also memorize your passphrase. Try writing your passphrase down several times and gradually commit it to memory.
If needed, use a **mnemonic technique** (e.g., creating a mental story from the words) to make it easier to remember.
