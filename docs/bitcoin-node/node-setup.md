# Setup a Bitcoin Node

There are several popular tools to help you set up a Bitcoin node, each with its own features and ease of use.

- [Raspibolt](https://raspibolt.org/) – One of the most widely used options, Raspibolt is a project designed for the Raspberry Pi. It provides a comprehensive step-by-step guide to help you build a DIY Bitcoin node from scratch.
- [Raspiblitz](https://docs.raspiblitz.org/) – Based on Raspibolt, Raspiblitz offers an automated installation process for setting up your Bitcoin node, making it easier to get started.
- [Minibolt](https://minibolt.minibolt.info/) – Like Raspibolt, Minibolt provides a step-by-step guide to building your own node, but it is designed for personal computers (desktop, laptop, or mini PC).
- [Parmanode](https://parmanode.com/parmanode/) –  A great alternative for both PC and Raspberry Pi users. While it’s less well-known, it’s a solid option created by Arman The Parman, offering a reliable setup.
- [Start9](https://start9.com/) – A software suite that allows you to run a self-hosted Bitcoin node on a hardware device. It’s designed to be user-friendly for both beginners and experts, with a focus on privacy, security, and decentralization. This makes it an excellent choice for users who want full control over their node setup.

Each of these options has its strengths, and choosing the right one depends on your needs, experience level, and hardware preferences.

I won’t go into detail on each guide, as they are already clearly explained by their authors. However, I may consider rewriting them in the future, adding my own personal style.
