# Backup your Seed

Your Bitcoin seed phrase is the key to your funds. If lost or compromised, your Bitcoin is gone forever. That’s why securing it properly is critical. While paper and digital backups can degrade, get lost, or be destroyed, metal seed storage offers a durable, fireproof, and waterproof solution.

## Why Use Metal Seed Storage?

- Fire & Water Resistance – Unlike paper, metal plates withstand extreme temperatures and flooding.
- Durability – Metal does not degrade over time like paper or electronic storage.
- Tamper Resistance – Securely stored metal backups prevent unauthorized access.
- Longevity – A well-engraved or stamped metal seed plate can last a lifetime, ensuring your Bitcoin is recoverable even decades later.

## How to Store Your Metal Backup Safely

- Keep it in a secure location (safe, hidden vault, or safety deposit box).
- Consider splitting your seed into multiple secure locations.
- Avoid storing it digitally or in places prone to theft or destruction.

By using a high-quality metal seed storage solution, you ensure your Bitcoin remains secure, regardless of disasters or time. Your Bitcoin is only as safe as your seed backup, protect it wisely.
