# Bitcoin Computer

Letâ€™s be clear:

:::danger
NEVER use a regular computer to create or broadcast your Bitcoin transactions!

## What is a Bitcoin Computer?

A Bitcoin computer is a dedicated device for securely creating and broadcasting Bitcoin transactions in a protected, malware-free environment. Transaction signing is handled by a hardware wallet or, ideally, an air-gapped computer for enhanced security.


## Why a Regular Computer is Dangerous

Using your everyday computer for Bitcoin transactions is risky because it can be exposed to malware.

If your computer becomes infected, an attacker could:

- View the balances of your Bitcoin addresses, but they can't spend your funds if you use a hardware wallet or an air-gapped computer to sign transactions.
- Physically threaten you if they believe you're a valuable target (as mentioned above).
- If you don't use a hardware wallet, they could change the address on the transaction you're about to sign by accessing your regular computer.
- If you do use a hardware wallet but it's compromised, they could still alter the address of the transaction you're going to sign.

Now that you understand what a Bitcoin computer is and why using a regular computer for Bitcoin transactions isn't safe, let's look at the best options for securing your setup.
