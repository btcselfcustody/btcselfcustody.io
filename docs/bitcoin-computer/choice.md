# Choosing a Bitcoin Computer

I recommend getting a laptop that suits the size of your Bitcoin stack. The most basic models available today are more than capable of handling what you'll need. The processor and RAM specifications aren’t a big concern, as even entry-level setups will do the job just fine.


## My Recommendation

Some people suggest buying a brand-new laptop for security reasons, but what about the BIOS? A factory-installed BIOS is often proprietary and may not be fully trustworthy. That’s why I recommend a laptop that allows you to flash a custom open-source BIOS. My preferred choice is Libreboot (see the guide here). Flashing it isn’t the easiest process, but the security benefits are well worth the effort.


### Budget Options

- **Low Budget** – The Lenovo ThinkPad [X230](https://psref.lenovo.com/syspool/Sys/PDF/withdrawnbook/ThinkPad_X230.pdf) or [T430](https://psref.lenovo.com/syspool/sys/pdf/withdrawnbook/thinkpad_t430.pdf). These are legendary laptops, possibly among the best ever made!
- **Medium Budget** – The Lenovo ThinkPad [T480s](https://psref.lenovo.com/syspool/Sys/PDF/ThinkPad/ThinkPad_T480s/ThinkPad_T480s_Spec.pdf). Recently supported by Libreboot, it’s easy to flash, supports NVMe SSDs, and can handle up to 24GB of RAM. This is an amazing laptop that can also be used for everyday tasks or other Bitcoin-related activities.


## Hardware Precautions

Since these laptops are often purchased second-hand on eBay, Gumtree, or Marketplace, it's important to take a few precautions before turning them into a Bitcoin computer:

- **Use a brand-new SSD** – If possible, replace the old storage drive with a new SSD. If you can’t afford one, at the very least, format the existing drive twice and encrypt it using LUKS.
- **Use new USB drives** – Avoid using old or unknown USB sticks for installation and backups. Start fresh with brand-new USB keys.
