# Nostr Signing Device (NSD)

The LNbits Nostr Signing Device (NSD) serves as a secure alternative to storing private keys on a computer. Your private key is stored on the NSD and signs nostr messages on the device. The NSD works with a Chrome based browser and the Horse extension.


## Why a NSD

A Nostr Signing Device (NSD) enhances security by keeping your private key isolated from your computer, reducing the risk of exposure to malware or keyloggers. Instead of storing your private key in a browser extension or software wallet, the NSD signs messages directly on the device, ensuring that sensitive cryptographic operations never leave the secure environment. This approach adds an extra layer of protection for your Nostr identity while maintaining ease of use through seamless integration with Chrome-based browsers and the Horse extension.

You can set up an NSD using the **LILYGOÂ® TTGO T-Display 1.14**. This device is available for purchase on AliExpress at this [link](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/33048962331.html?spm=a2g0o.order_list.order_list_main.5.3d471802y3Drvt)
