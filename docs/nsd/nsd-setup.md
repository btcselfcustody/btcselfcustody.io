# Setting up the Nostr Signing Device

### Clone the GitHub repository:

Open a terminal and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lnbits/nostr-signing-device.git
```

### Copy Required Libraries

Navigate to the `libraries` folder:

```bash
cd nostr-signing-device/libraries
```

Copy all the files in this folder and paste them into the `Arduino/libraries` directory (which should be empty if you just installed Arduino).

### Connect Your Nostr Signing Device (NSD)

Plug in your device via USB.


### Upload the Firmware Using Arduino IDE

- Open Arduino IDE.
- Go to `Tools → Port` and select the correct serial port (e.g., `/dev/ttyACM0`).
- Click `File → Open`, then select `snsd.ino` from the `nostr-signing-device/snsd/` folder.
- Click the Upload button (right-facing arrow in the toolbar).

### Verify Installation

If the upload completes without errors, your NSD is ready! You should see the LNbits welcome screen on the display.
