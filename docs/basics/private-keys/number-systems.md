# Number Systems

Before diving into Bitcoin keys, it’s important to understand how different number systems work. If you’re already familiar with binary, decimal, and hexadecimal, feel free to skip ahead.

### Decimal (Base 10):

- Each digit has 10 possible values (0-9).
- For example, in the number 4.25, the first digit is 4, the second is 2, and the third is 5.
- We count: 0, 1, 2, ..., 9. When we reach 9, we add a new digit to the left and reset the rightmost digit to 0 (e.g., 10).

### Binary (Base 2):

- Each digit has only 2 possible values (0 or 1).
- Counting in binary looks like this: 0, 1, 10, 11, 100, 101, 110, 111, 1000, 1001, 1010, 1011, etc.
- It may seem like a big jump, but that’s because we’re used to decimal counting.

### Hexadecimal (Base 16):

- Each digit has 16 possible values (0-9 and a-f, where a=10, b=11, ..., f=15).
- Just like playing cards where the Jack, Queen, and King represent specific numbers, letters can be used to represent numbers in hex.
- Hex numbers are more compact. For example, the decimal number 2047 is 11111111111 in binary (11 digits) but just 7FF in hex.
