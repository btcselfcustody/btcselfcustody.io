# Derivation Path

A derivation path determines how your private keys are derived from your seed phrase and which addresses are generated from those keys.


## The BIP32 Standard

The BIP32 (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) standard defines how hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallets work. HD wallets use a tree-like structure where every branch can produce a new keypair (private and public key). This means you only need to back up the seed phrase, and the wallet can regenerate all keys and addresses from that phrase.


## Anatomy of a Derivation Path

A typical derivation path looks like this:

```text
m / 44' / 0' / 0' / 0 / 0
```

Here’s what each part means:

- `m` - The master node (your seed phrase). This is the root of the tree.
- `44'` - The purpose or protocol. The apostrophe ('), known as the hardened separator, indicates that these keys are hardened for security.
- `0'` - The coin type. **For Bitcoin, this is always 0** (but for other cryptocurrencies, it would be a different number).
- `0'` - The account. A wallet can have multiple accounts, each with its own address.
- `0` - The change type (0 for external addresses, 1 for internal addresses like change).
- `0` - The address index. This is used to generate a new address each time.


## Common Derivation Paths

Here are some of the most common derivation paths used in Bitcoin wallets:

    #### BIP-44 (Universal Path for Multiple Coins)
    BIP-44 is the most widely used standard for creating wallets that manage multiple cryptocurrencies. It’s designed to support multi-asset wallets and has a clear, structured path for generating different addresses.

    Standard Path:

    ```text
    m / 44' / 0' / 0' / 0 / 0
    ```
    - `44'`: Indicates the wallet follows BIP-44 for multi-asset support.
    - `0'`: This specifies the Bitcoin coin type.
    - `0'`: Refers to the first account in the wallet.
    - `0`: The external addresses (i.e., the ones used to receive funds).
    - `0`: The first address in the external address list.

    Addresses starts with `1`:

    ```

    #### BIP-49 (Pay-to-Script-Hash with SegWit)

    BIP-49 defines a path for creating P2SH (Pay-to-Script-Hash) addresses, a type of Bitcoin address that begins with 3. This path is used for SegWit transactions, improving transaction efficiency and lowering fees.

    Standard Path:

    ```text
    m / 49' / 0' / 0' / 0 / 0
    ```
    - `49'`: Indicates SegWit addresses that start with 3 (P2SH).
    - `0'`: Specifies Bitcoin as the coin type.
    - `0'`: Refers to the first account.
    - `0`: External addresses.
    - `0`: The first address for receiving.

    Addresses starts with `3`:

    ```text
    33S43b6qmVHVTjwp75M7XoTTPEvKVh8zqH
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="bip84" label="BIP84">
    #### BIP-84 (Native SegWit with Bech32)

    BIP-84 is used to generate native SegWit addresses, which start with bc1q and are more efficient than older types of Bitcoin addresses. These addresses have a lower transaction fee and are fully compatible with the SegWit protocol.

    Standard Path:

    ```text
    m / 84' / 0' / 0' / 0 / 0
    ```
    - `84'`: Specifies **native SegWit** addresses (starting with bc1q).
    - `0'`: The coin type for Bitcoin.
    - `0'`: The first account.
    - `0`: External addresses.
    - `0`: The first address.

    Addresses starts with `bc1`:

    ```text
