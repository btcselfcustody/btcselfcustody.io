# What is Bitcoin Self Custody?

Bitcoin self custody means you are in full control of your Bitcoin.
No bank. No exchange. No company holding it on your behalf.

When you self custody, you hold your own private keys. These keys are what allow Bitcoin to be spent. If you control the keys, you control the Bitcoin.

This is very different from how traditional money works. With a bank account, your money is technically controlled by the bank. They decide when you can move it, freeze it, or block transactions. Bitcoin self custody removes that dependency entirely.

With self custody:
- No one can freeze your funds
- No one can block your transactions
- No one can confiscate your Bitcoin without your consent

This is what people mean when they talk about financial sovereignty.


## Private Keys and Seed Phrases

A private key is a secret number that proves ownership of Bitcoin.
Because private keys are hard for humans to manage directly, wallets usually give you a seed phrase (also called a recovery phrase).

The seed phrase:
- Is usually 12 or 24 words
- Can recreate all your private keys
- Is the real thing you must protect

If someone gets your seed phrase, they can steal your Bitcoin.
If you lose it and your wallet breaks, your Bitcoin is gone forever.

There is no “forgot password” button in Bitcoin.


## Ways to Self Custody Bitcoin

There are different levels of security, depending on your needs:

- Software Wallets: Apps installed on your phone or computer. Easy to use, good for learning or small amounts.
- Hardware Wallets: Dedicated devices that keep your keys offline. Much safer for long term savings.
- Air Gapped Setups: Advanced setups where the private key never touches an internet connected device. These are used by people who want maximum security.

You don’t need to start with the most complex option. Many people begin simple and upgrade their setup over time.

## Freedom Comes With Responsibility

Self-custody gives you freedom, but it also gives you responsibility.
- There is no customer support.
- No account recovery.
- No chargebacks.

This is why learning proper backups and safe storage is just as important as buying Bitcoin in the first place.
