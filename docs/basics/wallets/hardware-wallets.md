# What Is a Hardware Wallet?

A hardware wallet is a small physical device made specifically to protect your Bitcoin keys.

The private keys are created and stored inside the device and **NEVER** leave it. Even when the device is connected to a computer, the keys stay isolated.

This makes hardware wallets **much safer** than software wallets.


## Why Hardware Wallets Exist

Computers and phones are general purpose devices. They connect to the internet, run many programs, and are exposed to more risks.

A hardware wallet does one job only: protect your keys and sign transactions securely.

Because of this, hardware wallets are commonly used for:
- Long term savings
- Larger amounts of Bitcoin
- Peace of mind


## How Hardware Wallets Work

- You plug the device into your computer or phone
- You create a transaction using wallet software
- The hardware wallet signs the transaction internally
- The signed transaction is sent to the Bitcoin network
- At no point does your private key touch the internet.


:::tip Keep in Mind
- You still need to back up your seed phrase
- Losing the device is not a problem if you have the backup
- Hardware wallets are secure, but you remain responsible
- Think of a hardware wallet as a personal vault, not a bank.
