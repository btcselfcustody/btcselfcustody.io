By removing proprietary firmware like Intel Management Engine (ME) or AMD Platform Security Processor (PSP), Libreboot eliminates potential backdoors that could compromise the security of your device. In an AGC setup, where the primary concern is maintaining a completely isolated, tamper-proof system, using Libreboot ensures that no hidden code is running on your hardware, minimizing the risk of attacks. Libreboot is fully transparent, meaning its source code is available for review, making it an ideal choice for those who prioritize control over their system and its security."]}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.h2,{id:"os-linux-mint",children:"OS: Linux Mint"}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Linux Mint is a great choice for an AGC due to its balance of ease of use and stability.

During installation, you can select LUKS to encrypt the entire drive, protecting sensitive data even if the device is stolen or accessed without authorization. LUKS is widely regarded as one of the most reliable encryption standards on Linux, offering both strong security and flexibility. The system uses a passphrase to unlock the encryption, and it supports additional layers of protection, such as multiple key slots for different passphrases. With LUKS, your AGC can operate securely offline, with all data fully protected from unauthorized access, making it a perfect solution for safeguarding critical Bitcoin data and other sensitive files."})]})}function l(e={}){const{wrapper:t}={...(0,s.R)(),...e.components};return t?(0,n.jsx)(t,{...e,children:(0,n.jsx)(d,{...e})}):d(e)}},8453:(e,t,i)=>{i.d(t,{R:()=>o,x:()=>a});var r=i(6540);const n={},s=r.createContext(n);function o(e){const t=r.useContext(s);return r.useMemo((function(){return"function"==typeof e?e(t):{...t,...e}}),[t,e])}function a(e){let t;return t=e.disableParentContext?"function"==typeof e.components?e.components(n):e.components||n:o(e.components),r.createElement(s.Provider,{value:t},e.children)}}}]);
